# QuadruFred-PCB
A personal project Quadruped AKA QuadruFred. I have been working on for a while. I have decided to make a gen 2 and upgrade it in every way such as using custom PCB, using accelerometer for stabilization and overall a many mechanical changes to make it an overall smoother quadruped.
